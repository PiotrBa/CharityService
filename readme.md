# Charitable Donations and Gifts Application
## Overview

This Spring Boot application is designed to facilitate charitable donations and the distribution of gifts to those in need. It provides a platform for donors to contribute financially and in-kind, helping to make a positive impact on the community. Additionally, both users and administrators have their accounts, allowing full control over functions tailored to their roles, ensuring convenience and alignment with the individual needs of each.


## First step!

Here is a short demonstration of my new project. The frontend is ready for preview, and now I am focusing on creating the backend. I'm eagerly anticipating the development of this journey!  :)
